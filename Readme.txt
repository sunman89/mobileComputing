Sometimes the app might freeze for a bit whilst getting the users location, that might just be my phone though.
Landscape mode does not seem to work properly, I think that is because of the bearing of the phone being different
to when I mapped the location using my phone. Was told to map the location by using the phone in portrait mode.

I have only done a few unit tests, because the code that I used from the Indoor Atlas website regarding using their sdk to get the location, the methods/variables were always private. And I don't know how to unit test private methods. Some tutorials or linked material to instrument testing would of helped.

I have never used CircleCI before so not sure if I used it properly.It says I have gotten success on it, but a tutorial on this would of been great.

I tried to implement the map tracking on my app. But everytime I was trying to create a map fragment my code kept getting errors. If I had more time to spend on it I would of tried implementing a map fragment that I would of then used a ground overlay, to put the floor image of the current floor the user is on onto the map. And a marker that always is displayed upon location changed and on the current location of the user.
